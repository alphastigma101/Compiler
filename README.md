### Compiler 
```
    This is a open source project that uses c++ to compile and run custom programming language called tatical nuke.
    It is also has a virtual machine that can be used for learning new languages.

5. [Supported Languages](#supported-languages)

### Getting Started:
* You have two options you can do:
    - 1. You can run tatical nuke by issuing `make` inside the root directory to generate `exec_compiler, exec_interpreter, exec_virtual_machine`. If you are stuck on understanding tatical nuke's syntax, view the syntax located in `Code-Analysis`.
    - 2. Choose a language you want to learn, and launch a virtual machine along with the tools to help you get started. 
         You can also generate the code for a specific language and use that as a `boilder-plate`

### Product Construction
* The goal is split the product's code so that it has a interpreter and a compiler and a virtual machine. The virtual machine is used for downloading the language's interpreter or compiler, in terms of what the user wants to learn.
* The developer has the option to start out with a `boiler-plate` code 

### What Is Tatical Nuke
* Tatical Nuke is a toy language that I implemented myself. It is inspired by low level languages and has a mixture of keywords from modern languages. It should be able to compiled or interpreted because.... why not? 

* It will spam out random ASCI characters, and display TATICAL NUKE and delete itself, if the programmer messes up the syntax.

* That is it basically. 

### Project Motivation and Potential Applications

This project serves as my inaugural venture into crafting a `toy lagnuage`, a `compiler`, and a `virtual machine`. Beyond this primary goal, I'm eager to explore how the techniques learned can be applied to various domains in software development and data processing. Some intriguing areas for future exploration include:

- Parsing complex configuration files
- Handling data serialization formats
- Creating and processing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
- Advancing natural language processing capabilities
- Developing compiler front-ends
- Interpreting query languages
- Building code analysis and static checking tools
- Enhancing document processing systems
