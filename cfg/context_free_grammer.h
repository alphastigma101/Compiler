/*
 * A Context Free Grammar consists of a head and a body, which describes what it can generate.
 * The body's purest form will be a list of symbols and these symbols are:
    * (Terminal):
        * letter from the grammarâ€™s alphabet, which you can think of it as a literal value. They are the endpoints in a sense as you only produce one symbol
    * (Nonterminal):
        * is a reference of another grammar rule, which allows you to pick any rules for it 
 * The rule is on the very left side of the ->. On the other side of it are: 
    * Quoted strings which represent the "terminal"
    * Lowercase letters that are  "nonterminal"
